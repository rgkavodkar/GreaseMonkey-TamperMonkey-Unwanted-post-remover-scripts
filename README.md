YouTube Recommendations Remover

A chrome extension that removes the "Recommended channels" and "Recommended videos". 

The data from YouTube server does come to your browser even after installing this extension. It simply prevents that from being displayed. 
Looks for the right HTML tags that contains the aforementioned string(s), and sets the "display" value to "none".
So technically, these recommendations are still there; just not displayed anymore.

To add this to Chrome:
- Download the ext folder
- Go to Chrome > More Tools > Extensions
- Enter into "Developer mode"
- Click on "Load unpacked extension..."
- Provide the location for the "ext" folder
- Voila!
